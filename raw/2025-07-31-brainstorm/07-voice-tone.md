## SEKCJA 2.1: Voice & Tone

**JG:** Keeping it minimal and precise:

### CORE PERSONALITY TRAITS (3 max)
1. **Intellectually Curious** - Not intellectually superior
2. **Confidently Uncertain** - Strong opinions, loosely held
3. **Professionally Irreverent** - Serious about craft, not about status

### FORMALITY SPECTRUM

**Too Casual ❌**
"This API is totally borked lol"

**Just Right ✓**
"This API breaks in fascinating ways"

**Too Formal ❌**
"The application programming interface exhibits suboptimal behavior"

### HUMOR GUIDELINES

**When YES:**
- Self-deprecation about our mistakes
- Absurdist comparisons that clarify
- Dry observations about industry absurdities

**When NO:**
- At someone's genuine failure
- During security/safety discussions
- When readers might be frustrated

**Example:**
✓ "I've written this bug so many times, I'm considering making it a feature"
❌ "Another day, another data breach lol"

### TECHNICAL DEPTH CALIBRATION

**Level 1: The Hook** - Assume smart but not specialized
"Docker containers are like shipping containers for code"

**Level 2: The Explanation** - Build technical foundation
"Containers package applications with their dependencies"

**Level 3: The Deep Dive** - Respect expertise
"The OCI runtime spec defines how containers actually execute"

Always start at Level 1, signal transitions clearly.

**DL:** The spectrum examples are good. Add more edge cases.

**MW:** The humor section needs a "punch up, not down" rule.

**KS:** Make the personality traits more distinctive. Everyone claims "curious."

**JG:** Fair. Revising trait 1 to: **"Obsessively Specific"** - Details matter, vagueness dies.
