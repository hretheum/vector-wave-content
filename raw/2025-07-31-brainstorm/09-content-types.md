# Workshop #2: Content Framework

**Moderator:** Przechodzimy do Content Types. Molly, możesz poprowadzić?

**MW:** Let's define each content type with brutal clarity.

## SEKCJA 3.1: Content Types

**DEEP ANALYSIS (3000+ words)**
- Purpose: Comprehensive exploration of complex topics
- Elements: Original research, multiple perspectives, data visualization
- Success: 80%+ completion rate, 10+ minutes average time
- Example: "Why Rust Adoption Stalls: A 6-Month Study of 50 Teams"

**QUICK TAKES (500-800 words)**
- Purpose: Timely reactions to news/trends
- Elements: Single insight, clear position, immediate value
- Success: 3-minute read, high share rate
- Example: "OpenAI's New Model: The One Feature That Actually Matters"

**TECHNICAL TUTORIALS**
- Purpose: Teach implementation, not just concepts
- Elements: Prerequisites, tested code, error handling, "what can go wrong"
- Success: Reader successfully implements
- Example: "Building a Rate Limiter That Actually Scales"

**INDUSTRY CRITIQUE**
- Purpose: Call out bullshit with evidence
- Elements: Data, timeline, consequences, alternatives
- Success: Changes conversation, forces responses
- Example: "The $10B Kubernetes Tax: Who's Really Paying"

**TOOL REVIEWS**
Standardized Rubric:
1. What it claims vs. what it does
2. Real-world performance data
3. Hidden costs (time, money, complexity)
4. Who should actually use it
5. Better alternatives

**PREDICTIONS & ACCOUNTABILITY**
- Make specific, measurable predictions
- Set review dates
- Track accuracy publicly
- Analyze why we were wrong

**BT:** Each type needs different editorial workflows.

**DL:** Add required sample sizes for any claims in Deep Analysis.

**KS:** Tool Reviews need conflict of interest disclosure upfront.

**JG:** Like the accountability aspect. Most pundits memory-hole bad predictions.
