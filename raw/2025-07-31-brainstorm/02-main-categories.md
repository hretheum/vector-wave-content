## Brainstorming głównych kategorii struktury

**Moderator:** Świetne pytania. Zacznijmy od wysokiego poziomu - jakie główne sekcje powinien zawierać skuteczny style guide dla bloga technicznego?

**BT:** Let me start with a framework. A style guide serves three functions: operational efficiency, quality control, and brand consistency. Structure should reflect these:

1. **Foundation Layer** - Core philosophy, audience definition, success metrics
2. **Execution Layer** - Writing standards, technical guidelines, formats
3. **Scaling Layer** - Processes, workflows, quality gates

**KS:** Ben's being too academic. Here's what actually matters:
- **Voice & Personality** - Who the fuck are we and why should anyone care?
- **What We Write About** - And more importantly, what we DON'T
- **How We Write** - Actual examples, not theory
- **Quality Control** - How we avoid publishing crap

**JG:** I'd argue for extreme minimalism:
1. **Principles** (3-5 max)
2. **Standards** (technical accuracy, fact-checking)
3. **Examples** (good vs bad, side by side)
4. **Tools** (what we use and why)

**DL:** You're all missing the data component. Based on my analysis of successful tech blogs:

```
Critical Sections (correlation with success > 0.7):
- Audience Personas (specific, data-backed)
- Content Types & Formats (with performance benchmarks) 
- Technical Standards (code examples, versioning, testing)
- Editorial Process (measurable quality gates)
- Performance Metrics (what we measure and why)
```

**MW:** *sighs* Everyone's overcomplicating this. Readers care about:
1. **Is this bullshit?** (accuracy standards)
2. **Will I understand this?** (clarity guidelines)
3. **Why should I trust you?** (transparency & corrections policy)
4. **What's in it for me?** (reader value proposition)

The structure should answer these questions first.

**KS:** Molly's right. Start with reader needs, not writer needs.

**BT:** Interesting convergence. Let me synthesize:

**PROPOSED TOP-LEVEL STRUCTURE:**
1. **Mission & Anti-Mission** (What we are, what we're not)
2. **Audience & Value Proposition** 
3. **Voice & Tone Guidelines**
4. **Content Standards**
   - Technical Accuracy
   - Writing Quality
   - Visual Standards
5. **Content Types & Formats**
6. **Editorial Process & Workflow**
7. **Performance & Iteration**

**JG:** Too many sections. Combine 3&4, merge 6&7.

**DL:** We need a section on **Data & Research Standards**. How we cite sources, verify claims, present statistics.

**MW:** And **Ethics & Corrections**. How we handle mistakes, conflicts of interest, sponsored content.

**KS:** Don't forget **The Blacklist** - shit we absolutely won't do. Sometimes what you won't do defines you more than what you will.
