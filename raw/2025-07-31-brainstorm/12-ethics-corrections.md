## SEKCJA 4.2: Ethics & Corrections

**MW:** Transparency builds trust. Here's how:

**CORRECTION HANDLING**
- Same prominence as original error
- "CORRECTION:" in title
- Explanation of what changed and why
- Timestamp of correction
- Original text struck through, not deleted

Example:
"CORRECTION: Our analysis stated X. Actually Y because [evidence]. Original text preserved below."

**DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS**
Start of article disclosures:
- Financial interests
- Personal relationships  
- Preview/review access
- Sponsored content (LARGE warning)
- AI tool usage

**COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTION**
- Name contributors (with permission)
- Link to original insights
- "Thanks to @user for spotting..."
- Annual contributor recognition

**ETHICS CHECKLIST**
- Is this our story to tell?
- Have we verified harm claims?
- Are we punching up, not down?
- Did we try to get comment?
- Would we publish if it were about us?

**KS:** Add "No anonymous sources for positive claims."

**DL:** Each correction needs data on how error occurred.

**BT:** Strong framework. The checklist prevents most issues.
