# Workshop #4: Performance & Blacklist

## SEKCJA 5.1: Metrics & Success

**DL:** Only measure what drives quality:

**MEANINGFUL METRICS**
- Completion rate (>70% target)
- Time on page vs. estimated read time
- Return visitor rate
- Technical comment quality score
- Code implementation success rate
- Correction frequency (<2%)

**VANITY METRICS TO IGNORE**
- Raw pageviews
- Generic shares
- "Great post!" comments
- Keyword rankings

**CONTENT LIFECYCLE**
- 3 months: Performance review
- 6 months: Accuracy check
- 12 months: Major update or archive
- 24 months: Retire or rewrite

## SEKCJA 5.2: The Blacklist

**KS:** The shit we won't do, period:

**INSTANT REJECTION TRIGGERS**
- "In today's fast-paced world" opening
- "AI will replace all developers"
- Uncredited rewrites of documentation
- "Ultimate guide" with <2000 words
- Trend pieces without original research
- "X is dead" without evidence
- SEO-bait listicles
- Untested tutorial code
- Sponsored content disguised as analysis

**BANNED APPROACHES**
- Hype amplification
- Fear-driven headlines
- Vague predictions
- Personal attacks
- Platform tribalism

**MW:** Add "No crypto shilling disguised as technical content."

**BT:** The lifecycle approach prevents content rot.

**JG:** Blacklist needs quarterly updates based on new BS trends.
