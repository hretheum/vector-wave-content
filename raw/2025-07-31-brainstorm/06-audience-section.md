## SEKCJA 1.2: Audience & Value Proposition

**BT:** Let me apply proper segmentation theory here:

### PRIMARY PERSONAS (data-backed)

**Persona 1: The Technical Founder (35%)**
- Building products, not just talking about them
- Needs: Strategic insights, technical depth, contrarian takes
- Pain: Wading through hype to find signal
- Reading time: 5am or 11pm (around the build cycle)

**Persona 2: The Senior Engineer (30%)**  
- 5+ years experience, seen multiple hype cycles
- Needs: Deep technical analysis, architecture patterns, "what actually works"
- Pain: Surface-level content that wastes expertise
- Reading time: Lunch break, commute

**Persona 3: The Tech-Adjacent Professional (25%)**
- Product managers, designers, VCs, tech-curious
- Needs: Accessible depth, business implications, trend decoding
- Pain: Either too basic or too jargon-heavy
- Reading time: Morning coffee, flight delays

**Persona 4: The Skeptical Learner (10%)**
- Career switchers, junior devs, students
- Needs: Honest career advice, learning paths, myth-busting
- Pain: "Learn to code in 30 days" bullshit
- Reading time: Evenings, weekends

### WHAT READERS GET
1. **Time Savings** - 20 hours of research distilled to 20 minutes
2. **Decision Confidence** - Data to back up or challenge choices
3. **Intellectual Ammunition** - Arguments for the next architecture review
4. **Career Leverage** - Knowledge that differentiates in interviews/discussions
5. **Schadenfreude** - Well-documented failures of overhyped tech

### WHAT WE EXPECT FROM READERS
- **Intellectual Honesty** - Question us, but bring data
- **Attention Span** - Some ideas need 3000 words
- **Technical Courage** - Try things, report back
- **Community Value** - Share insights, not just consume

**DL:** Your percentages seem made up. Where's the data?

**BT:** Fair point. These are hypotheses to validate with analytics post-launch.

**MW:** The "Schadenfreude" point is honest. People love a good tech disaster story.

**KS:** "Tech-Adjacent Professional" is too soft. Call them "Technical Decision Makers."

**JG:** The expectations section works. Sets the right bar.
