**Moderator:** Editorial Process i Ethics. Kara, start us off.

## SEKCJA 4.1: Editorial Process

**KS:** Here's a process that actually works:

**IDEATION â†’ PUBLICATION WORKFLOW**

1. **Pitch** (even to yourself)
   - Problem/insight in 1 sentence
   - Why now?
   - What's new/contrarian?

2. **Research Gate**
   - 3+ sources identified
   - Key data points found
   - Counterarguments explored

3. **Outline Review**
   - Structure validates thesis
   - Each section has purpose
   - Examples identified

4. **First Draft**
   - Write ugly, edit pretty
   - Hit main points
   - Mark [NEEDS DATA] holes

5. **Technical Review**
   - Code tested
   - Claims verified
   - Sources checked

6. **Editorial Polish**
   - Voice consistency
   - Flow optimization
   - Headline/hook refinement

7. **Pre-publish Checklist**
   - All [NEEDS DATA] resolved
   - Images optimized
   - Meta description written
   - Social assets created

8. **Post-publish**
   - Monitor comments first 24h
   - Fix errors immediately
   - Track performance

**MW:** Add a "cooling period" - 24h minimum between writing and publishing.

**BT:** Each gate needs clear pass/fail criteria.

**DL:** Where's the peer review for technical content?

**JG:** Between steps 5 and 6. Technical accuracy before polish.
