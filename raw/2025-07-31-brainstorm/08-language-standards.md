## SEKCJA 2.2: Language Standards

**DL:** Data shows certain patterns correlate with engagement. Here's what works:

### CLARITY PRINCIPLES

**1. Specificity Over Generality**
❌ "Performance improved significantly" 
✓ "Page load dropped from 3.2s to 0.8s (75% improvement)"

**2. Active Voice Default**
❌ "The bug was discovered by our team"
✓ "We discovered the bug"
Exception: When actor is genuinely unknown or irrelevant

**3. Progressive Complexity**
Start simple → Add nuance → Dive deep
"API rate limiting prevents overload" → "by tracking requests per time window" → "using token bucket algorithms"

### FORBIDDEN PHRASES (instant rejection)
- "In today's fast-paced world" - We know what year it is
- "Leverage" (as verb) - Use "use"
- "Seamless integration" - Describe the actual seams
- "Best practices" - Without specific context
- "Cutting-edge" - Say what version/year
- "Revolutionary/Game-changing" - Unless literally true
- "Delve into" - AI content marker
- "It's worth noting" - Just note it

### POWER WORDS (use sparingly, with data)
- "Failed" - When something actually failed
- "Breakthrough" - With evidence of the break
- "Critical" - When failure has real consequences
- "Precisely" - Followed by exact numbers
- "Surprisingly" - With data showing expectation vs reality

### TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY APPROACH

**The Sandwich Method:**
1. Plain explanation
2. Technical term (with brief definition)
3. Concrete example

**Example:**
"The system stores frequently accessed data in fast memory (this cache reduces database load). When you visit a website repeatedly, cached assets load instantly instead of downloading again."

**Term Introduction Limits:**
- Max 3 new technical terms per section
- Define on first use
- Link to glossary for depth
- Use consistently after introduction

**MW:** Missing: How to handle acronyms.

**DL:** Good catch. Add:

### ACRONYM RULES
- Spell out first use: "Large Language Model (LLM)"
- Exception: Universal acronyms (API, URL, CPU)
- Never nest acronyms: "API URL" not "API for the URL"
- Re-introduce after 1000+ words

**KS:** The forbidden phrases list needs quarterly updates. Language evolves.

**BT:** Strong foundation. The sandwich method scales well.
