## SEKCJA 3.2: Quality Standards

**DL:** Quality needs measurable criteria. Here's my framework:

**TECHNICAL ACCURACY**
- Every claim needs a source or test
- Code must run in specified environment  
- Version numbers for all dependencies
- Performance claims need benchmarks
- Security assertions need proof

Testing Protocol:
1. Fresh environment setup
2. Copy-paste test (no modifications)
3. Edge case validation
4. Performance verification
5. Security scan if applicable

**RESEARCH STANDARDS**
- Minimum 3 primary sources for claims
- Data less than 6 months old (unless historical)
- Methodology transparency
- Conflicts of interest declared
- Peer review for Deep Analysis pieces

**DATA PRESENTATION**
- No charts without source data
- Axes must start at zero (unless justified)
- Color-blind friendly palettes
- Mobile-responsive visualizations
- Raw data downloadable

**VISUAL STANDARDS**
- Screenshots: annotated, relevant portion only
- Diagrams: vector format, editable
- Code: syntax highlighted, line numbers
- Max image size: 200KB (optimized)
- Alt text mandatory

**CODE EXAMPLE REQUIREMENTS**
```markdown
## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+

**KS:** Add "No Lorem Ipsum in any example ever."

**MW:** Each code block needs error handling shown.

**BT:** The measurability focus is correct.
