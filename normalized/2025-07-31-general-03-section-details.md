# Creative Summary
A granular breakdown of content architecture—each section is purpose-built to serve audience needs, ensure clarity, and deliver value through trust, style, and process transparency.

# Key Messages
- Sections need explicit mission, value, and boundaries
- Voice, quality, and process must be defined to avoid ambiguity
- Every part of the framework is audience- and outcome-focused

# Content Highlights
- Mission/Anti-mission thinking: what we commit to and what we’ll never do
- Emphasis on trust, data, and transparency as core to each section’s value
- Practical checklist for outlining, reviewing, and evolving sections over time

# Platform Adaptations
## Twitter Thread
- Hook: "Stop generic sections—define mission and anti-mission and win reader trust."
- Key thread points: Mission/Anti-mission, trust checklist, quality standards for each section
## LinkedIn Post
- Professional angle: Transparent, accountable editorial unit design
- Value: How clear structure drives better team and reader experience

# Original Content
## Głębsze zanurzenie w strukturę - detale sekcji

**Moderator:** OK, mamy zarys głównych kategorii. Zejdźmy głębiej - co konkretnie powinno znaleźć się w każdej sekcji?

**KS:** I'll start with **Mission & Anti-Mission** because if you fuck this up, nothing else matters:

**MISSION & ANTI-MISSION**
- One-sentence mission (no bullshit corporate speak)
- 3 things we'll ALWAYS do
- 5 things we'll NEVER do (be specific - "never use 'leverage' as a verb")
- Our promise to readers (what they can count on)

**VOICE/STYLE**
- What’s in-bounds for tone and voice (no jargon? humor allowed?)
- Prohibited patterns, dangerous clichés

**FORMAT**
- Canonical deliverables: Typical length, word count, images, embeds
- Template or starting visual (if any)

**QUALITY**
- What objectivity, sourcing, measurable standards look like for this section
- Pass/fail checklist for submission

**PROCESS**
- How the section gets updated, reviewed, versioned, sunset
- Who owns it, and how audience or team feedback is integrated
