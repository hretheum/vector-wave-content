# Creative Summary
A no-compromise framework outlining how VECTOR WAVE ensures technical, research, style, and disclosure quality for every piece. Concretely measurable, fully testable, and built for audience trust—a QA protocol for all editorial outputs.

# Key Messages
- Quality must be defined, measurable, and reviewable
- Claims, code, and sources require explicit validation
- Transparency and correction handling are as crucial as content itself

# Content Highlights
- Automated and manual checklists for evidence, code, and citation
- Public correction and disclosure policies formalized
- End-user trust and reliability as the final measure of quality

# Platform Adaptations
## Twitter Thread
- Hook: "Uphold quality like a pro: our editorial QA protocol goes beyond spellcheck."
- Key points: 5 research standards, test protocols for code, correction transparency
## LinkedIn Post
- Professional: Editorial QA is about process and proof, not just intent
- Value: Raise the bar—encode transparency, evidence, and disclosure in your team’s standards

## SEKCJA 3.2: Quality Standards

**DL:** Quality needs measurable criteria. Here's my framework:

**TECHNICAL ACCURACY**
- Every claim needs a source or test
- Code must run in specified environment  
- Version numbers for all dependencies
- Performance claims need benchmarks
- Security assertions need proof

Testing Protocol:
1. Fresh environment setup
2. Copy-paste test (no modifications)
3. Edge case validation
4. Performance verification
5. Security scan if applicable

**RESEARCH STANDARDS**
1. Original or cited source for every claim
2. Contrast alternative explanations
3. Replicate or attempt counter-examples
4. Visualize whenever possible (charts, diagrams)
5. Annotated code/data if present

**STYLE & CLARITY**
- Write for the audience (not the author)
- Maximum 1 jargon/concept per paragraph
- No 'softening'—be direct
- Headlines: focus on value (“What will reader gain?”)

**TRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE**
- All financial or personal interests disclosed at start
- List critical sources, datasets, tools used
- Errors or corrections must be public, timestamped
