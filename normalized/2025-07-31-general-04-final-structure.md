**Moderator:** Świetna dyskusja. Spróbujmy teraz sfinalizować strukturę.

**BT:** Based on our discussion, here's the synthesized structure:

**VECTOR WAVES STYLE GUIDE - FINAL STRUCTURE v1.0**

### 1. FOUNDATION
- **1.1 Mission & Anti-Mission**
  - Our purpose (one sentence)
  - What we always do (3 principles)
  - What we never do (5 hard rules)
  - Reader promise
  - Sunset clause

- **1.2 Audience & Value Proposition**
  - Primary personas (data-backed)
  - Why people should care
  - Unique value vs. existing resources

### 2. STRUCTURE
- Clear section layout: mission, value, format, owner, updating

### 3. WORKFLOW
- How content moves from idea -> draft -> review -> update/final
- Update/versioning guidelines
- Explicit sunset and “why/when to update” criteria
