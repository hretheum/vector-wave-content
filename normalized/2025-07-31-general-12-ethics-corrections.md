# Creative Summary
Direct and unambiguous protocols designed to maximize audience trust: how VECTOR WAVE handles transparency, public disclosures, and visible corrections—so readers always see the full truth.

# Key Messages
- Corrections must be as visible as the original error
- All disclosures of interest (financial, relational, etc.) are mandatory and public
- Ethics are ensured through structured process, not afterthoughts

# Content Highlights
- Correction protocol: timestamp, strikeout, and side-by-side explanations
- Disclosure checklist for all relevant interests and influences
- Emphasis on inversion: trust is built by showing all sides including mistakes

# Platform Adaptations
## Twitter Thread
- Hook: "We don’t 'fix quietly'—our corrections live where the error was."
- Key points: Correction protocol, public timestamp, disclosure checklist
## LinkedIn Post
- Professional: Building trust by owning and showcasing all editorial corrections
- Value: Practical steps for institutional honesty that set your work apart

# Original Content
## SEKCJA 4.2: Ethics & Corrections

**MW:** Transparency builds trust. Here's how:

**CORRECTION HANDLING**
- Same prominence as original error
- "CORRECTION:" in title
- Explanation of what changed and why
- Timestamp of correction
- Original text struck through, not deleted

Example:
"CORRECTION: Our analysis stated X. Actually Y because [evidence]. Original text preserved below."

**DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS**
Start of article disclosures:
- Financial interests
- Personal relationships  
- Previous collaborations or conflicts

(End of protocol)
